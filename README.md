# Notflix 

### The Netflix Clone 

This project was a test of my ReactJS, Redux and Firebase Skills. I wanted to mimic a site like Netflix while still giving a pretty obvious apperance of not being exact. I currently use this to show seniors how easy it is to be duped online, and what to look outfor when visiting websites. I had a lot of fun making this project and expect to do a lot more in the near future!

### How to Use

If you want to use this code your self, feel free. You have to create your own Swipe Account as well as a Firebase account to use as is. They need specific API keys as well as an app key for Firebase. Easiest way to get up and running is to create your own keys.js file, then ass the API_KEY from Swipe (Private Key), firebaseApiKey and firebaseAppId from Firebase as const variables to the file and export all of them. 

Thank you for your time!

# Getting Started with Create React App and Redux

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
